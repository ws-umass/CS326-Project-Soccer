# Application Idea

The idea of this project is to solve students' confusion about the difficulty of each course offered by CICS at UMass Amherst. I am a junior in Informatics major. During my three years at UMass, I felt like I missed a lot of great opportunities. I think one of the biggest reasons is that I am very struggling when choosing courses each semester. When students are choosing courses in SPIRE, they cannot intuitively understand the difficulty of the course. The only way most students learn about the difficulty of a course is to ask their friends. This leads to a large bias, and students do not recognize the difficulty of the course at the beginning of the semester. As a result, students may find it difficult to succeed in demanding courses due to low expectations. At the end of each semester, the school asks students to fill out surveys about each course, but the results of these surveys were not made public by the school.

This project will try to solve this problem through surveys and statistics, so that each student can arrange their courses reasonably and have confidence in the beginning of the new semester. All surveys in this application will be published anonymously to protect the privacy of users.
