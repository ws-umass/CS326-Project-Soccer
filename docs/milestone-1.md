# Application Idea

The idea of this project is to solve students' confusion about the difficulty of each course offered by CICS at UMass Amherst. I am a junior in Informatics major. During my three years at UMass, I felt like I missed a lot of great opportunities. I think one of the biggest reasons is that I am very struggling when choosing courses each semester. When students are choosing courses in SPIRE, they cannot intuitively understand the difficulty of the course. The only way most students learn about the difficulty of a course is to ask their friends. This leads to a large bias, and students do not recognize the difficulty of the course at the beginning of the semester. As a result, students may find it difficult to succeed in demanding courses due to low expectations. At the end of each semester, the school asks students to fill out surveys about each course, but the results of these surveys were not made public by the school.

This project will try to solve this problem through surveys and statistics, so that each student can arrange their courses reasonably and have confidence in the beginning of the new semester. All surveys in this application will be published anonymously to protect the privacy of users.

# Functionality

The application will display all courses offered by CICS at UMass Amherst on the home page. All courses will be grouped according to the level of the course. When a student clicks on a particular course, expand the description of the course. In the course description, the professors for the current semester of the course will be listed, along with the professors' average rate grade, highest and lowest rate grades in the database. Students can complete a survey about the course by clicking the survey button. The results filled in by the user will be saved in the database, and after refreshing the page, the data will be updated to new statistical results through the database. At the bottom of the course description, the historical trend of students' evaluation of professors and the trend of the average grade for each semester of the course will be displayed. In this way, when students need to understand a course, they can fully understand the expected difficulty of the course and the students' evaluation of the professor.
